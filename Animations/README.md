To demonstrate our point more easily, and to make people understand what this mod is about quickly, we will make some intuitive animations that describe what our mod does.

To make GIFs easily, we use MS PowerPoint to make the animation and render them by saving them as GIFs.

The resulting GIFs will need optimization because they are by themselves unnecessary large and Workshop will reject them. I use https://ezgif.com/optimize and set optimization to Lossy GIF (100). This is good enough for general GIFs. Longer GIFs may need stronger optimization parameter to get it below the Workshop limit.
