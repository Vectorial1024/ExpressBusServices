Based on my IRL experience in Hong Kong, I can notice 2 differences between HK-IRL and CSL bus operations, and these 2 differences became the 2 problems that motivated me to make this mod.

[h1]Difference/Problem 1: Buses always stop at every stop[/h1]
This greatly reduces efficiency of buses (and probably made them unusable) in the following cases:
[list]
[*]Buses stop at bus stops when it is full, the stop has passengers waiting, but no one alights the bus (especially when used with Real Time mod, during the rush hours)
[*]Buses stop at bus stops when it is empty, the stop has no one, and no one alights the bus (e.g. in night-time)
[/list]
To address this, I borrow the concept of "bus bells" and "wave hand" from Hong Kong. When passengers want to alight the bus, they ring the bus bells (now electrified) to signal the driver to let them off at the next stop. At bus stops, passengers wanting to board buses wave their hands to signal the driver to stop at the stop. When no one signals the bus driver, the driver may simply omit the stop and proceed to the next one (they still need to travel along the predefined route though).

In this mod the above mode of operation is implemented as "buses depart the stop immediately if no one alight from the bus + if no one boards the bus". Buses still need to stop at stops to see if there are passengers wanting to alight the bus, but this is already a huge improvement.

New: it is now possible to choose other modes of stop-skipping so that the efficiency boost is stronger. However, do note that the Experimental mode is only for trying out latest things and may be unstable.

[h1]Difference/Problem 2: Buses unbunch at every stop[/h1]
Jesus Christ. If it were in Hong Kong the driver would have been berated to death by passengers. We don't do that there.

Essentially, this mod restores the pre-vanilla unbunching update bus behaviors that, after boarding and alighting, buses depart the stops immediately.

Knowing that this will easily result in multiple buses arriving at the same stop at the same time when enough time passes, I add in a restriction that buses still use the vanilla unbunching feature when they are at the first stop of the route. Plan your bus termini wisely!

This is especially helpful especially when you are using the Real Time mod and the Transport Line Manager mod at the same time and set the line budget during rush hour to e.g. 150% or 200%; in vanilla unbunching, the buses would simply wait at stops to unbunch forever because of the increased amounts of buses often overlapping each other in unbunching distance.

[h1]What you can do with this mod[/h1]
With this mod enabled, you can do the following:
[list]
[*]Long stretch of roads but too tight for metro/tramway? Use buses instead.
[*]Sparse, fast metros with parallel-running feeder bus routes? Sure.
[*]150% rush-hour bus budget with Real Time + Transport Lines Manager? Why not.
[*]Long-distance, high-frequency bus routes/shuttles? No longer a dream.
[*]Earn profit from bus routes on a per-line basis (upkeep for depots etc still has to be sourced elsewhere)

And that's all!

基於我自己喺香港嘅經歷，以及對本game(CSL)觀察所得嘅兩大問題，我有兩大原因去整呢個mod：

[h1]問題/原因1：CSL巴士須每站停車[/h1]
我將佢改做：除指定車站外(例如總站)，如無乘客上落車，巴士須立即開車。

最新消息：依家可以揀其他飛站模式，例如係「Aggressive模式」直接飛站。另外留意，「Experimental模式」係試新嘢專用，有機會令飛站出現問題。

[h1]問題/原因2：CSL巴士有"防拖卡政策"[/h1]
首先介紹吓"防拖卡政策"：巴士須於車站停留，使得前車與後車之間能保持一定距離。

我將佢改做：取消此政策。

[h1]有何好處?[/h1]
你可以順利模擬部分香港交通形勢：
[list]
[*]大埔公路/青山公路：飛走荒蕪車站
[*]港島線+電車：一快一慢，平排競爭
[/list]
